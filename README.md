# PM2.5_Prediction_Deep_Learning

# Project Motivation
Develop an artificial neural network that can predict PM2.5 given parameters such as T =Average Temperature (°C) ,TM = Maximum temperature (°C) ,Tm == Minimum 
temperature (°C) , SLP = Atmospheric pressure at sea level (hPa) , H = Average relative humidity (%) , VV = Average visibility (Km) ,V = Average wind speed (Km/h) ,
VM =Maximum sustained wind speed (Km/h). The best model hyperparamters was selected using keras tuner.
